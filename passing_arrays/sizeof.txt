Always pass the size of the array as a parameter. The least problematic way to do this is to let the compiler compute the number of elements. Consider the following code:

    float listSmall[5];
    cout << sizeof(listSmall) << endl;     // sizeof(float) * 5 == 20
    cout << sizeof(listSmall[0]) << endl;     // sizeof(float) == 4
    cout << sizeof(listSmall) / sizeof(listSmall[0]) << endl;     // 20 / 4 == 5 NumElements!

Thus, it is very common to pass the size of a list using the following convention:
    fillList(listSmall, sizeof(listSmall) / sizeof(listSmall[0]) );

This expression is worth memorizing.
