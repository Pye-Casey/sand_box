Null-character
The null-character ( '\0' ) is a special character used to designate the end of a c-string. We can assign the null-character to any char variable:
{
    char nullCharacter = '\0';  // single character assigned a null
    char text[256];             // text is just an array of characters
    text[0] = '\0';             // putting the null at the beginning signifies
                                // an empty string
    
}
The value of the null-character is 0 on the ASCII Table:
    assert('\0' == 0);
There is a special reason why the null-character was given the first slot on the ASCII table: it is the only character that equates to false when cast to a bool . In other words:
    assert('\0' == false);
Since zero is the only integer mapping to false , we can assume that the null-character is the only false character in the ASCII table.
