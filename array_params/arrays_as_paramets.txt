The parameter declaration in the callee looks much like the declaration of an array. There is one exception however: there is no number inside the square brackets. The reason for this may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first: the callee does not know the size of the array. Consider the following example:
/********************************************
* DISPLAY NAME
* Display a userâ€™s name on the screen
********************************************/
void displayName(char lastName[], bool isMale) // no number inside the brackets!
{
    if (isMale)
        cout << "Brother ";
    else
        cout << "Sister ";
    cout << lastName; // treated like any other string
    
    return;
}
In this example, the first parameter ( lastName ) is a string. For the rest of the function, we can treat lastName like any local variable in the function.
